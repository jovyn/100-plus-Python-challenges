'''
You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, score) tuples by ascending order where name is string, age and score are numbers.
The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:

1: Sort based on name
2: Then sort based on age
3: Then sort by score
The priority is that name > age > score.

If the following tuples are given as input to the program:
Tom,19,80
John,20,90
Jony,17,91
Jony,17,93
Json,21,85
Then, the output of the program should be:

[('John', '20', '90'), ('Jony', '17', '91'), ('Jony', '17', '93'), ('Json', '21', '85'), ('Tom', '19', '80
'''

print("Enter Name,age,score and Enter to quit :")
lst = []
while True:
    input_str = input()
    if len(input_str) == 0:
        break
    else:
        input_str = tuple(input_str.split(","))
        lst.append(input_str)

lst.sort(key = lambda x:(x[0],x[1],x[2]))
print(lst)
